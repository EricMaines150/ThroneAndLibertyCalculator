I wrote this calculator script to help myself figure out optimal stat distributions in the game Throne and Liberty.
It uses some basic assumptions from information given in game, but does not have any sort of integration with the game's codebase; it is not guarenteed to be accurate or all encompassing. 

I will probably not be expanding on this script further as I no longer play the game.
